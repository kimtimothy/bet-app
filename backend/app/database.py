Database configuration for the friendly betting app.

This module uses SQLAlchemy to set up a SQLite database and provide a
session generator for interacting with the database within FastAPI
endpoints.  SQLite is used for its simplicity; for production use a more
robust database (e.g. PostgreSQL) is recommended.
